The goal of this project is to develop a data cleaning pipeline for multiple CSV files. The process involves:

- Column Standardization: Ensure consistent naming conventions across all files.
- Data Formatting: Uniformly format data types (e.g., dates, numerical values, strings).
- Null Value Handling: Fill or remove null values using appropriate methods.
- Managing Missing Columns: Detect and populate missing columns with logical default values.
- Output: Save the cleaned data back to CSV files.
The final deliverable will be clean, well-formatted CSV files ready for analysis, accompanied by the Python script used for the cleaning process and documentation of the methods applied.
